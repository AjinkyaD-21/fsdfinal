          Students explore a range of topics that form the basis for their mathematical understanding. These encompass Number Systems, which cover integers, rational and irrational numbers, along with absolute value and operations. Algebra progresses with linear equations in one variable, exponents, and expression evaluation. Geometric concepts include detailed examinations of lines, angles, properties of triangles, quadrilaterals, and the ideas of congruence and similarity. Students also dive into Mensuration, tackling perimeter, area, surface area, and volume calculations for various shapes. Data Handling introduces data organization, representation through bar graphs, pie charts, and basic probabilities. The Cartesian plane and graphing linear equations are part of the Introduction to Graphs. Ratios, proportions, and percentages teach quantitative relationships and their real-world applications. Finally, Linear Equations in Two Variables build upon earlier algebraic knowledge by involving equations, their graphs, and solutions with two variables. These topics collectively equip students with essential mathematical skills and insights.</p>
